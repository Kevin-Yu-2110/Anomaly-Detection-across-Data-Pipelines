Project Setup (w1-w3)
- Design Full System Architecture
- Implement proof-of-concept frontend react framework
- Implement proof-of-concept backend Django framework
- Implement proof-of-concept data pipeline with MLFflow tracking server using learning model trained on MNIST
- Implement proof-of-concept full-stack routes
- Dependency Management (requirements.txt + package.json)
- Implement Github Workflow Pipelines (for automated backend tests)

Sprint One (w4-w5)
- Implement user authentication/registration
- Implement make-transaction and transaction-history in client and business-client home pages
- Implement frontend/backend user-state and session with react context, JWT and django.auth
- Prevent JWT impersonation attacks via comparison between requesting user fields and decoded token fields
- Implement CORS and CSRF security policy

Sprint Two (w6-w8)
- Create update-username and update-email backend routes
- Create get-transaction-history backend route
- Update user sign-up with features required for anomaly analysis
- Update make-transaction route with features required for anomaly analysis
- modify all frontend/backend routes from using application/json to multipart/form-data
- merge client/business dashboards, remove accountType specification from frontend/backend
- remove bloated frontend styling (login_page_style.css) + fix css styling for login-page/signup-page/password-reset-page
- create searchable dropdown menus for user-sign up + update backend user_signup routes for model compatibility
- create feature processing scripts for frontend dropdown menus
- update make, get and process routes for compatibility between transaction handling and model calls
- create detect_anomaly backend route to link backend with detection models + move models directory to backend folder
- overhaul Transaction model and backend transaction routes to match model features exactly (full-stack)

Sprint Three (w9-w10)
- Add Clear History Button to User Profile + frontend UI functionality + backend clear_transaction_history route
- separate account user from transaction user (update user model + frontend sign-up form + backend routes/tests to reflect such)
