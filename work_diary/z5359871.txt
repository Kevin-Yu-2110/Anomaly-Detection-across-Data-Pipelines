- Submitted project proposal

Sprint 1:
Week 4
- Brainstorm and research possible models for anomaly detection
- Created a basic Autoencoder model 
- Tested basic Autoencoder model with basic preprocessed data
- Created 2 other neural network models that did not work well
- Found a more suitable dataset and finalised dataset selection

Week 5
- Prepared model results for demo A
- Meeting with team after demo for retrospective/reflection on sprint 1 as well as discussing plans for sprint 2
- Submitted retrospective A

Sprint 2:
Week 6
- Planned objectives for sprint 2 with group
- Trained Autoencoder model on actual dataset
- Trained KNN model on actual dataset
- Trained SVC model on actual dataset
- Trained Gradient boosted tree model on actual dataset
- Trained Random Forest model on actual dataset
- Trained Adaboosted tree model on actual dataset

Week 7
- Assessed model accuracy
- Created predict function for each model for backend to call
- Explore ways to improve model preformance
- Performed hyperparameter tuning for KNN, Gradient boosted tree and Random Forest model
- Explored options for better predictions such as combining models
