Week 1
- Joined group
- Selected project 15 based on the skillset of group members
- Set up jira

Week 2
- Finalised group members and project selection
- Selected as scrum master

Week 3
- Met with client 
- Worked on and wrote user stories, requirements section of project proposal together with rest of the group
- Wrote the sprints and novelty section of project proposal 
- Created user stories on Jira and assigned some for first sprint
- Submitted project proposal

Sprint 1:
Week 4
- Brainstorm and research possible models for anomaly detection
- Created a basic Autoencoder model 
- Tested basic Autoencoder model with basic preprocessed data
- Created 2 other neural network models that did not work well
- Found a more suitable dataset and finalised dataset selection

Week 5
- Prepared model results for demo A
- Meeting with team after demo for retrospective/reflection on sprint 1 as well as discussing plans for sprint 2
- Submitted retrospective A

Sprint 2:
Week 6
- Planned objectives for sprint 2 with group
- Trained Autoencoder model on actual dataset
- Trained KNN model on actual dataset
- Trained SVC model on actual dataset
- Trained Gradient boosted tree model on actual dataset
- Trained Random Forest model on actual dataset
- Trained Adaboosted tree model on actual dataset

Week 7
- Assessed model accuracy
- Created predict function for each model for backend to call
- Explore ways to improve model preformance
- Performed hyperparameter tuning for KNN, Gradient boosted tree and Random Forest model
- Explored options for better predictions such as combining models
- Extracted list of possible values for categorical features

Week 8 
- Fixed warnings from data preprocessing
- Fixed problem where model was not loaded correctly as well as problem with prediction function
- Worked with Henry on fixing the model to predict correctly with correct encoders
- Planned model preformance demo for progressive demo B
- Prepared data inputs for demo
- Meeting with team after demo for retrospective/reflection on sprint 2 as well as discussing plans for sprint 3
- Submitted retrospective B

Week 9 
- Tried using SMOTE on GBT and Adaboost models
- Eliminated bad models
- Performed hyperparameter tuning for Adaboost
- Reformatted GBT and Adaboost models to be used for backend and allow for retraining
