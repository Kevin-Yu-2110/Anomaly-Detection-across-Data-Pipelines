### Sprint One
# week 4
- Create basic model for anomaly detection using isolation forests
- Explored other possible anomaly detection models including local outlier factor and SVM

# week 5
- selected new dataset that's more comprehensive
- cleaned up dataset to extract variables in the correct format
- implemented basic mlflow logging

# week 6
- added ability to log statistics to track performance of IsolationForest model
- began developing alternative anomaly detection models and testing performance - LocalOutlierFactor
